                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I'm a Manchester based salesman and musician with a new challenge in sight.</p>
                <p>I got into coding after several friends recommended it and I tried a couple of free taster courses. I then decided to start a part-time programming bootcamp at Command Shift, which I'm very excited about!</p>

                    <h4>Indoor rock climbing</h4>
                    <p>I started bouldering in summer 2022 and have become obsessed.</p>
                    <p>It's a mental battle as much as a physical one.</p>
                    <p>Each route has a specific sequence of moves which need to be figured out and completed to reach the top, much like life.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4>Electronic music</h4>
                    <p>I started playing the drums as a teenager, and eventually my interests turned to music production and DJing.</p>
                    <p>I've released various different EPs and remixes which you can listen to below.</p>
